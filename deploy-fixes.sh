DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED:

✅ Fix #1: ESBuild configured to output CommonJS format instead of ESM
✅ Fix #2: Package.json created without "type": "module" for CommonJS execution  
✅ Fix #3: Server configured to bind to port 5000 on 0.0.0.0 interface
✅ Fix #4: All ES6 imports converted to CommonJS requires in production build
✅ Fix #5: Deployment configured with correct port mapping (5000 -> 80)

Deployment Configuration:
- Build: CommonJS bundle at dist/index.js
- Start: NODE_ENV=production node index.js  
- Port: 5000 (external port 80)
- Interface: 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)

The React app will be built on deployment server due to 1900+ modules.
